"America is founded upon the rule of law....
Where there is no law there is no opportunity
where there is no justice there is no liberty
where there is no safety there is no future
we must never give into anger or hatred
if malice or violence reigns then none of us is free."


TRUMP
We're going to clamp down. You have to arrest people and you have to threaten them and you have to put em in jail for ten years and you'll never see this stuff again
and you have to know that

If you don't dominate your city and your state they're gonna walk away with you.
You gotta have total domination
Then you have to put em in jail.

You can't do the thing where they do one week in jail, these are terrorists.
